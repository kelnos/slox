# Contributing

While in general I would say contributions are gladly accepted, this
project exists primarily to allow me to learn about programming
language, interpreter, compiler, and VM development.

If you notice a small bug here or there and want to send me a PR, feel
free, but I'm not interested in accepting large features or
improvements; the point of this exercise is that *I* should be
implementing those sorts of things.
